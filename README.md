## Project Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a Vite project with vanilla JavaScript and adding Sass for styling.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js & npm

Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can check by running:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If it's not installed, download it from (https://nodejs.org/en) nodejs.org and install it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download or Clone the Project

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone https://autocode.git.epam.com/deabocina9/capstone-project-template.git
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Project Dependencies

Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

```
npm install
```

This will download all necessary packages listed in package.json. If Vite is not listed in devDependencies, install it manually:

```
npm install vite --save-dev
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Compile Sass

Since the project uses Sass, you need to compile SCSS files into CSS. Run:

```
npm run compile
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Development Server

Run the following command to start the project:

```
npm run dev
```

This will launch a local server (default: http://localhost:5173/). You should now see the project running in your browser.
